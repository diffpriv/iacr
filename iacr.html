I have served on the PCs of various IACR conferences, and as an Associate Editor for the Journal of Cryptology. As a director, I will help promote the technology transfer of cryptography into real-world applications, and I will help maintain a culture that is welcoming to women and underrepresented minorities, to people with diverse backgrounds, just as it was welcoming to me.

<b> Longer statement: </b>
</h2>

<font size = 5>
I have been a member of IACR since 2008. Over the years, I have served on the PCs of various IACR conferences such as CRYPTO and TCC. I am also serving as an Associate Editor for the Journal of Cryptology. I have also served on the PCs of various security conferences and served as the program co-chair of ACM CCS and FC.

As a director, I would like to help promote the technology transfer of cryptography into real-world applications. I would also like to help ensure that our community is welcoming to researchers with diverse backgrounds (e.g., demographics, gender, and research backgrounds), just as it was welcoming to me.
